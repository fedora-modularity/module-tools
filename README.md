### Base Run Time dependency solver 
 * `./brt_dep_solver.sh <package>` - produce files with dependencies

For verbose output set variable VERBOSE to true:

    # VERBOSE=true ./brt_dep_solver.sh <package>

For debugging you might want to keep all files generated by dependecy solver
(not just the ones with resuls).
Set variable CLEAN to false to keep all these files.

    # VERBOSE=false ./brt_dep_solver.sh <package>
